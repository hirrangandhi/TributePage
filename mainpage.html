                S.A.Chandrasekhar. But, people criticized him for his look in the movie. Vijay doesn't lose his hope; he
                tried to do his best and continued to act in movies.<br><br>
                Then,In 1996, Vijay performed in the Vikraman-directed "Poove Unakkaga", which became his first
                acclaimed performance as well as the breakthrough in Vijay's career and made him a recognizable star.

                it made him as a pakka commercial mass actor. He started following the same template commercial pattern
                and acted "Ghilli" which was a mega blockbuster. Ghilli broke all the previous records in the Kollywood
